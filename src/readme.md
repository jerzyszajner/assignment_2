# FC Barcelona Squad List - Educational Project

This project was developed as an Individual Assignment 2 for the Frontend Development (FFU1100) module during Semester 1 of my studies. The primary objective was to demonstrate responsive design skills by creating a webpage showcasing the squad list of a sports team using card layouts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Responsive design techniques for optimal display on different screen sizes

## Project Description

The website displays the current squad of **FC Barcelona**, with each player featured in an individual card that includes their image and relevant statistics (e.g., appearances, goals, assists). The cards are categorized into sections based on player positions: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Forwards, and Coaching Staff.

## Problems during the project:

I faced an issue with hiding the team**card-info section when the hover effect on the team**card ended. I resolved it by adjusting the transform properties and ensuring smooth transitions for seamless visibility and hiding.

### Features:

- Responsive design to adapt the layout across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- Each card includes key details such as jersey number, position, and season statistics
- Hover effects on player cards to reveal additional information

### Note on Images and Copyright

All images of players and the FC Barcelona logo are used solely for **educational and demonstrational purposes** and are sourced from the official [FC Barcelona website](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/football/first-team/players#midfielders). These images are not used for any commercial purposes and serve only to enhance the realism and educational value of this project.

This project is a non-commercial, student-created work with the aim of demonstrating my skills in web development, particularly in the areas of responsive design and layout creation.
